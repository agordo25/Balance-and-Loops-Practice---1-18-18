#1 - 3.6-float 
    7-integer
    "hello"-string
    true-boolean
    
#2 true 
#3 I would add up all the numbers 1 through 10. I would then add up all the numbers from 11-20 and see if thee is a pattern. 
A pattern that could be seen as presented in class is n(n+1)/2. The two is there because of two rows.
#4 total=0
for num in range(101)
  total=total+num
print(total)
#5 False  True  False
#6 for number in range(30)
   if number %2=0
      print(number,"is an even number")
#7 for number in range(15,30)
   if number %2=0
      print(number,"is an even number")
